In this post, I will guide you through deploying Directus on the DigitalOcean (DO) App Platform. With DO Apps, you can effortlessly establish a Directus environment using just a Dockerfile. This post will guide you through a more advanced setup with a separate persistent database, file storage, and cluster synchronization. 

DigitalOcean is a well-loved cloud hosting provider with automatic scaling. It's perfect for both rapid development and full-scale production, and if you find yourself already ingrained into the DO product line, then this is a great choice for you.

Of course, it becomes your responsibility to maintain your set up. If you are looking for something that is more "hands off" and requires zero setup or knowledge on infrastructure, then check out [Directus Cloud](https://directus.io/pricing/cloud). This is hosting provided by the team who build Directus, and is the easiest way to deploy, upgrade, and backup your Directus project.
  

## Before You Start

As well as the DigitalOcean app that runs Directus, there are several additional requirements to run a production Directus project within the DO App platform:

- **Managed Database** — You will need a database for Directus. This can be hosted either within the DO ecosystem, or externally.
- **Redis Droplet** — If you plan to have a clustered app, you will need to setup a Redis droplet to be able to synchronize across multiple instances.
- **DigitalOcean Spaces** — Directus supports any S3-compatible storage for files, and DO Spaces is exactly this.

You may not need a Redis droplet in development, but a clustered environment is something you may need to consider as your application scales.

## Create a Dockerfile Repository

DigitalOcean can deploy an application from a Dockerfile hosted in a GitHub or GitLab repository. Create a new repositry, and create a single file called `Dockerfile`:

```
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4
FROM directus/directus:10.6.2
USER root
RUN corepack enable \
&& corepack prepare pnpm@8.7.6 --activate \
&& chown node:node /directus
EXPOSE 8055
USER node
CMD : \
&& node /directus/cli.js bootstrap \
&& node /directus/cli.js start;
```

- It's recommended to specify a version of the Directus image. If this is omitted, the latest version will always be used, which could cause errors if there are any breaking changes. You can update the version here to update Directus.
- Corepack is enabled as it allows us to use the pnpm package manager (used by Directus) without installing it.
- Chown gives the proper permissions needed for node to access the files.
- Port 8055 is exposed, which DigitalOcean will read and handle automatically during deployment. 
- The bootstrap command is run to pull info from the ENV to either install the database (if it's empty) or migrate it to the latest version (if it already exists and has missing migrations).

## Create a Managed Database

If you've already got an existing database, you don't have to create a new one now and can move on to the next section. 

DigitalOcean offers hosted [databases](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases). Create a new one (I recommend starting with PostgreSQL) and take note of the connection details.

## Create a Redis Droplet

If you are setting up a production environment, you should now set up a Redis droplet for synchronization across containers. Follow this [DigitalOcean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-redis-on-ubuntu-20-04). If you allready have an existing Redis server, you can use that.

Directus currently does not support clustered Redis. If this changes, this process will become easier as this setup will be able to utilize DO's Managed Redis service.

## Setup DigitalOcean Spaces Object Storage**:

Persistent file uploads requires an external storage volume. On the DigitalOcean App Platform, this means using the Spaces Object Storage, which has a S3-compatible API. 

[Set up DigitalOcean Spaces here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces).

## Create a Directus App

1. In your DigitalOcean dashboard, navigate to the Apps section and click **Create App**.
2. Link the repository with your Dockerfile that you created earlier. You may need to connect your account to GitHub/GitLab to access your repository.
3. You'll encounter a page with an auto-generated name for your app. You should see the name of your repository below. This setup is recognized as a web service, which is suitable for Directus.
4. Adjust the app's plan to your requirements, including the number of containers and their capabilities. 
5. Connect to the managed database you crafted earlier. Attaching the database to the app is a recommended best practice, ensuring smooth firewall and security settings. Then, select your database cluster and user.
6. Input the necessary [environment variables](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/config-options.html) for Directus. A set of basic variables will help you get started, but ensure you complete all necessary fields. The bulk editor simplifies this task, and you can always return to edit or add more variables later.

```
KEY="randomly-generated-key"
SECRET="randomly-generated-secret"
DB_CLIENT="pg"
DB_HOST="dbhost"  
DB_PORT="25060" 
DB_DATABASE="your_db"
DB_USER="doadmin"
DB_PASSWORD="dbpass"
DB_SSL__CA=""
STORAGE_LOCATIONS=digitalocean
STORAGE_DIGITALOCEAN_DRIVER=s3
STORAGE_DIGITALOCEAN_KEY="your-storage-key"
STORAGE_DIGITALOCEAN_SECRET="your-storage-secret"
STORAGE_DIGITALOCEAN_ENDPOINT="your-storage-endpoint-url"
STORAGE_DIGITALOCEAN_BUCKET="your-storage-bucket-name"
STORAGE_DIGITALOCEAN_REGION="your-storage-region"
REDIS_HOST="host-ip"
REDIS_PORT="6379"
REDIS_PASSWORD="redis-password"
CACHE_ENABLED="true"
CACHE_STORE="redis"
CACHE_AUTO_PURGE="true"
MESSENGER_STORE="redis"
SYNCHRONIZATION_STORE="redis"
PUBLIC_URL=${APP_URL}

ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@example.com"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="hunter2"
```

:::info Random key & Secret

For generating your `KEY` and `SECRET`, you can use [this tool](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32).

:::

For database connection settings, you can either utilize DigitalOcean's predefined variables or use the connection settings found on the managed database page. If you wish to delve deeper into Digital Ocean's environment variables, consult their [documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/use-environment-variables/). Additionally, don't forget to incorporate the CA certificate, available within the database connection settings.

Once you've reviewed your configurations and confirmed everything's in order, proceed by clicking "Create App". This action kickstarts the building and deployment phase.

## Deploy Your Project

During this step, all that's left for you is to patiently wait as your tailored Directus application undergoes construction and deployment. Digital Ocean will cache the image you've just built, ensuring it's available for spawning new containers during any auto-scaling events.  

After the build, the deployment process takes the stage. This phase initializes Directus, oversees its bootstrap operations, and verifies the backend's functionality. If everything transpires without a hitch, you'll witness a successful deployment notification.

Upon entering the application dashboard, you'll encounter a comprehensive view of your application's health. It provides insights into recent deployments, facilitates forced deployments, and more. Prominently displayed is your generated application URL. If you want to use a custom URL for your backend, navigate to the settings tab and add one. As an added convenience, SSL certificatess are already managed for you.

## Summary

This guide offers a path to deploying Directus on the DigitalOcean App Platform. For those familiar or already ingrained with DO, the App Platform is a great choice to host your project.

Any alterations to the environment variables or Dockerfile automatically triggers re-builds and deployments. All deployments are executed with zero-downtime and any unsuccessful builds will default back to the lastest successful deployment. Your data's integrity is preserved with Spaces object storage and your managed database, ensuring your data's safety if you decide to suspend the app for subsequent migrations to another service provider.

I have been doing web dev for well over 18 years now. While I have learned and used a lot of different methods, languages, and frameworks to acheive success for my clients. In my pursuit of the ideal backend, Directus continues to hit every single checkbox required for mine and my clients needs and has become a cornerstone of my tech stack. I hope this guide helps you get started and have many successful projects!
