# Directus Guest Author Program

Become a Directus Guest Author and get paid to write about your favorite tech topics that leverage our platform. We’ll support you in creating a great concept and writing the best piece possible, then we’ll distribute the work to our user and developer communities.

[Check out the Directus Developer Blog](https://docs.directus.io/blog/)

## How Does It Work? 

This process ensures that we work with you to create the best possible content, while also ensuring that the content fits within our publication guidelines.

1. Submit an idea for an original piece of written content by [opening an issue](https://github.com/directus-community/guest-authoring/issues/new/choose).
2. Collaborate with our team to finalize the idea in the issue until the overall content and structure is approved.
3. Take some time to read our [writing guidelines](./writing-guidelines.md).
4. Fork this repo, create a new directory for your post based on the template, and submit a PR when the first draft is done. 
5. Review the draft with our team.
6. Revise the content based on feedback in the PR.
7. Once complete, we will publish the final version on our developer blog and get pay you up to $500.

## What Ideas Are Accepted?

We may change the scope over time, but for now, we are interested in:
- Tutorials that use Directus such as “Build A Budgeting Application With Directus”.
- Examples of applications using Directus with various environments and frameworks such as “Build an iOS App With Directus”.
- Tutorials that extend default functionality, such as “Creating An Extension To Send Stripe Invoices”.
- Advanced-level tutorials explaining how to use one or more Directus features.

Some additional guidelines you must follow when creating ideas to apply with:
- Posts must use code, unless you're using our Directus Flows automation feature.
- Posts must be original. This means a new and unique topic that has not been published elsewhere.
- Posts must not be generated with AI services or models - we expect you to author them from beginning to end.
