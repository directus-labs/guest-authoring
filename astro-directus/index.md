## Introduction

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a highly performant web framework used for building content-heavy websites. In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a website using Directus as a headless CMS. You will store, retrieve, and use global metadata such as the site title, create new pages dynamically based on Directus items, and build a blog.

## Before You Start

You will need:

- To install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a code editor on your computer.
- A Directus project - you can use [Directus Cloud](https://directus.cloud/) or [run it yourself](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/quickstart.html).
- Some knowledge of TypeScript and Astro framework

## Initialize Astro and Install the Directus SDK

Open your terminal to run the following command to create a new Astro project:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

During installation, when prompted, choose the following configurations:

```bash
Where should we create your new project? ./astro-directus
How would you like to start your new project? Include sample files
Install dependencies? Yes
Do you plan to write TypeScript? Yes
How strict should TypeScript be? Strict

```

Once completed, navigate into the new directory and delete all the contents in the `pages/index.astro` file so you can build the project from scratch and install the Directus JavaScript SDK:

```bash
cd astro-directus
npm i @directus/sdk
```

Open the `astro-directus` directory in a text editor of your choice and run `npm run dev` in the terminal to start the development server at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Create a Helper for the SDK

To create an instance of the Directus SDK that multiple pages in the project will use, create a new directory called `lib` and a new file called `directus.ts` inside of it with the following content:

```ts
import { createDirectus, rest, } from '@directus/sdk';

//Structure of the data you will be fetching from Directus
type Global = {
  title: string;
  description: string;
}
type Author = {
  name: string
}
type Page = {
  title: string;
  content: string;
  slug: string;
}
type Post = {
  image: string;
  title: string;
  author: Author;
  content: string;
  published_date: string
  slug: string;
}

type Schema = {
  posts: Post[];
  global: Global;
  pages: Page[];
}

const directus = createDirectus<Schema>(YOUR_DIRECTUS_URL).with(rest());

export default directus;


```

Ensure your Directus URL is correct when initializing the Directus JavaScript SDK.

## Using Global Metadata and Settings

In your Directus project, navigate to Settings -> Data Model and create a new collection called `global`. Under the Singleton option, select 'Treat as a single object', as this collection will have just a single entry containing global website metadata.

Create two text input fields - one with the key of `title` and one `description`.

Navigate to the content module and enter the global collection. Collections will generally display a list of items, but as a singleton, it will launch directly into the one-item form. Enter information in the title and description field and hit save.

 ![A form named "Global" has two inputs - a title and a description, each filled with some text.](global-data.png)

 By default, new collections are not accessible to the public. Navigate to Settings -> Roles & Permissions -> Public and give Read access to the Global collection.

 In your `pages/index.astro` file, add the following to fetch the data from Directus and display it:

```ts
---
import Layout from "../layouts/Layout.astro";
import directus from "../lib/directus";
import { readSingleton } from "@directus/sdk";

const global = await directus.request(readSingleton("global"));
---
<Layout title={global.title}>
  <main>
    <div>
      <h1>{global.title}</h1>
      <p>{global.description}</p>
    </div>
  </main>
</Layout>
```

Refresh your browser. You should see the data from your Directus Global collection displayed in the index page.

## Creating Pages With Directus

### Set up Directus

Create a new collection called `pages` - make the Primary ID Field a "Manually Entered String" called `slug`, which will correlate with the URL for the page. For example `about` will later correlate to the page `localhost:4321/about`.

Create a text input field called `title` and a WYSIWYG input field called `content`. In Roles & Permissions, give the Public role read access to the new collection.

Create some items in the new collection

### Setup Dynamic Routes in Astro

Inside of the `pages` directory, create a new file called `[slug].astro`. Astro can use dynamic route parameters in a filename to generate multiple, matching pages.

```ts
---
import Layout from "../layouts/Layout.astro";
import directus from "../lib/directus";
import { readItems } from "@directus/sdk";

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const pages = await directus.request(readItems("pages"));
  return pages.map((page) => ({
    params: { slug: page.slug },
    props: page,
  }));
}
const page = Astro.props;
---
<Layout title={page.title}>
  <main>
    <h1>{page.title}</h1>
    <div set:html={page.content} />
  </main>
</Layout>
```

Because all routes must be determined at build time in Astro, a dynamic route must export a `getStaticPaths()` function that returns an array of objects with a params property. Each of these objects will generate a corresponding route.

Go to `http://localhost:4321/about`, replacing `about` with any of your item slugs. Using the Directus JavaScript SDK, the item with that slug is retrieved, and the page should show your data.

```
:::warning 404s and Trusted Content
Non-existing slugs will result in a 404 error. Additionally,
[`set:html` should only be used for trusted content.](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#sethtml)_

:::
```

## Creating Blog Posts With Directus

Create a new collection called `authors` with a single text input field called `name`. Create one or more authors.

Then, create a new collection called `posts` - make the Primary ID Field a "Manually Entered String" called   , which will correlate with the URL for the page. For example `hello-world` will later correlate to the page `localhost:4321/blog/hello-world`.

Create the following fields in your `posts` data model:

- a text input field called `title`
- a WYSIWYG input field called `content`
- an image relational field called `image`
- a datetime selection field called `published_date` - set the type to 'date'
- a many-to-one relational field called `author` with the related collection set to `authors`

In Roles & Permissions, give the Public role read access to the `authors`, `posts`, and `directus_files` collections.

Create some items in the posts collection - here's some sample data.

### Create Blog Post Listing

Inside of the `pages` directory, create a new directory called `blog` and a new file called `index.astro` inside of it.

```ts
---
import Layout from "../../layouts/Layout.astro";
import directus from "../../lib/directus";
import { readItems } from "@directus/sdk";

const posts = await directus.request(
  readItems("posts", {
    fields: [
      "slug",
      "title",
      "published_date",
      { author: ["name"] },
    ],
    sort: ["-published_date"],
  })
);
---

<Layout title="Blog">
  <main>
    <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
  </main>
</Layout>

```

This query will retrieve the first 100 items (default), sorted by publish date (descending order, which is latest first). It will only return the specific fields we request - `slug`, `title`, `published_date`, and the `name` from the related `author` item.

Display the fetched data in HTML:

```ts

<Layout title="Blog">
  <main>
    <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
 <ul>
  {
    posts.map((post) => (
      <li>
        <a href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
        </a>
        <span>
          {post.published_date} &bull; {post.author.name}
        </span>
      </li>
    ))
  }
 </ul>
  </main>
</Layout>

```

Visit `http://localhost:4321/blog` and you'll find a blog post listing, with the latest items first.

 ![A page with a title of "Blog". On it is a list of three items - each with a title, author, and date. The title is a link](blog-post.png)

### Create Blog Post Pages

Each blog post links to a page that does not yet exist. In the `pages/blog` directory, create a new file called `[slug].astro` with the content:

```ts
---
import Layout from "../../layouts/Layout.astro";
import directus from "../../lib/directus";
import { readItems, readItem } from "@directus/sdk";

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await directus.request(readItems("posts", {
    fields: ['*', { relation: ['*'] }],
  }));
  return posts.map((post) => ({ params: { slug: post.slug }, props: post }));
}
const post = Astro.props;
---
<Layout title={post.title}>
  <main>
    <img src={`${YOUR_DIRECTUS_URL}/assets/${post.image}?width=500`} />
    <h1>{post.title}</h1>
    <div set:html={post.content} />
  </main>
</Layout>

```

Some key notes about this code snippet.

- The `width` attribute demonstrates Directus' built-in image transformations.
- Once again, `set:html` should only be used if all content is trusted.
- Because almost-all fields are used in this page, including those from the image relational field, the `fields` property when using the Directus JavaScript SDK can be set to `*.*`.

Click on any of the blog post links, and it will take you to a blog post page complete with a header image.

## Add Navigation

While not strictly Directus-related, there are now several pages that aren't linked to each other. Update the `Layout.astro` file to include a navigation. Don't forget to use your specific page slugs.

```ts
  <body>
    <nav>
      <a href="/">Home</a>
      <a href="/about">About</a>
      <a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a>
      <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>
      <a href="/blog">Blog</a>
    </nav>
    <slot />
  </body>
```

## Next Steps

Through this guide, you have set up an Astro project, created a Directus instance, and used it to query data. You have used a singleton collection for global metadata, dynamically created pages, as well as blog listing and post pages.
