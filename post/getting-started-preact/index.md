## Introduction

Fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API. In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a website using Directus as a headless CMS. You will store, retrieve, and use global metadata such as the site title, create new pages dynamically based on Directus items, and build a blog.

Before You Start

You will need:

To installÂ Node.jsÂ and a code editor on your computer.

A Directus project - you can useÂ Directus CloudÂ orÂ run it yourself.

Some knowledge of Preact framework

## Initializing Preact

The modern way to get started is using Vite bundler instead of old preact-cli

## Using Global Metadata

In your Directus project, navigate to Settings -> Data Model and create a new collection called global. Under the Singleton option, select 'Treat as a single object', as this collection will have just a single entry containing global website metadata.

Create two text input fields - one with the key of title and one description.

Navigate to the content module and enter the global collection. Collections will generally display a list of items, but as a singleton, it will launch directly into the one-item form. Enter information in the title and description field and hit save.

By default, new collections are not accessible to the public. Navigate to Settings -> Access Control -> Public and give Read access to the Global collection.

## Setup Routing

We will load Blog Post List, detail page, dynamic pages and a 404 page.

```js
import { render } from "preact";
import { LocationProvider, Router, Route } from "preact-iso";

import { NotFound } from "./pages/_404.jsx";
import { BlogList } from "./pages/blog/list.jsx";
import { Blog } from "./pages/blog/slug.jsx";
import { Page } from "./pages/slug.jsx";
import { Home } from "./pages/index.jsx";

import { Header } from "./components/Header.jsx";
import "./style.css";
export function App() {
    return (
        <LocationProvider>
            <Header />
            <main>
                <Router>
                    <Route path="/" component={Home} />

                    <Route path="/blog" component={BlogList} />
                    <Route path="/404" component={NotFound} />
                    <Route path="/blog/:slug" component={Blog} />
                    <Route path="/:slug" component={Page} />
                </Router>
            </main>
        </LocationProvider>
    );
}
render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

## Creating Pages With Directus

Create a new collection called pages - make the Primary ID Field a "Manually Entered String" called slug, which will correlate with the URL for the page. For example about will later correlate to the page localhost:3000/about.

Create a text input field called title and a WYSIWYG input field called content. In Access Control, give the Public role read access to the new collection. Create 3 items in the new collection

Inside of pages, create a new file called slug.jsx. This is a dynamic route, so a single file can be used for all of the top-level pages.

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from "preact/compat";
import { useRoute, useLocation } from "preact-iso";
import directus from "../utils/directus";
import { readItem } from "@directus/sdk";
export function Page() {
    const { params } = useRoute();
    const location = useLocation();
    const [page, setPage] = useState({});
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
        setLoading(true); // Set loading state to true when fetching data

        const fetchData = async () => {
            try {
                const page = await directus.request(
                    readItem("pages", params.slug)
                );
                setPage(page); // Assuming posts.data contains an array of blog posts
            } catch (error) {
                location.route("/404");
                console.error("Error fetching page:", error);
            } finally {
                setLoading(false);
            }
        };

        fetchData();
    }, [params.slug]);

    return (
        <div>
            {loading ? (
                <p>Loading...</p>
            ) : (
                <>
                    <h1>{page.title}</h1>
                    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: page.content }} />
                </>
            )}
        </div>
    );
}
```

Go to http://localhost:3000/about, replacing about with any of your item slugs. Using the Directus JavaScript SDK, the single item with that slug is retrieved, and the page should show your data. readItem() only checks against your slug Primary ID Field.

![About Page](./images/about-page.png)
Note that we check if a returned value exists, and return a 404 if not. Please also note thatv-html should only be used for trusted content.

## Creating Blog Posts With Directusâ€‹

Create a new collection called authors with a single text input field called name. Create one or more authors.

Then, create a new collection called posts - make the Primary ID Field a "Manually Entered String" called slug, which will correlate with the URL for the page. For example hello-world will later correlate to the page localhost:3000/blog/hello-world.

Create the following fields in your posts data model:

-   a text input field called title

-   a WYSIWYG input field called content

-   an image relational field called image

-   a datetime selection field called publish_date - set the type to 'date'

-   a many-to-one relational field called author with the related collection set to authors

In Access Control, give the Public role read access to the authors, posts, and directus_files collections.

Create 3 items in the posts collection

## Create Blog Post Listingâ€‹

Inside of the pages directory, create a new subdirectory called blog and a new file called list.jsx inside of it.

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from "preact/compat";
import { Link } from "preact-router";
import directus from "../../utils/directus";
import { readItems } from "@directus/sdk";
export function BlogList() {
    const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
        setLoading(true); // Set loading state to true when fetching data

        const fetchData = async () => {
            try {
                const posts = await directus.request(
                    readItems("posts", {
                        fields: [
                            "title",
                            "published_date",
                            "author.name",
                            "slug",
                        ],
                    })
                );
                console.log("ðŸš€ ~ fetchData ~ posts:", posts);
                setPosts(posts); // Assuming posts.data contains an array of blog posts
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("Error fetching posts:", error);
            } finally {
                setLoading(false); // Set loading state to false when data is fetched (whether success or error)
            }
        };

        fetchData();
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
            {loading ? (
                <p>Loading...</p>
            ) : (
                <ul>
                    {posts.map((post) => (
                        <li key={post.slug}>
                            <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>
                                <h2
                                    style={{
                                        textAlign: "left",
                                        textDecoration: "underline",
                                        cursor: "pointer",
                                    }}
                                >
                                    {post.title}
                                </h2>
                            </Link>
                            <div style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
                                <span>{post.published_date}</span>
                                <span> &bull; {post.author.name}</span>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                    ))}
                </ul>
            )}
        </div>
    );
}
```

This query will retrieve the first 100 items (default), sorted by publish date (descending order, which is latest first). It will only return the specific fields we request - slug, title, publish_date, and the name from the related author item.

Visit http://localhost:3000/blogand you should now see a blog post listing, with latest items first.

![Blog Posts](./images/blog-posts.png)

Click on any of the blog post links, and it will take you to a blog post page complete with a header image.

## Create Blog Post Detail Page

Each blog post links to a page that does not yet exist. In the pages/blog directory, create a new file called slug.jsx:

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from "preact/compat";
import { useRoute, useLocation } from "preact-iso";
import directus from "../../utils/directus";
import { readItem } from "@directus/sdk";
export function Blog() {
    const { params } = useRoute();
    const location = useLocation();
    const [post, setPost] = useState({});
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
        setLoading(true); // Set loading state to true when fetching data

        const fetchData = async () => {
            try {
                const post = await directus.request(
                    readItem("posts", params.slug)
                );
                setPost(post); // Assuming posts.data contains an array of blog posts
            } catch (error) {
                location.route("/404");
                console.error("Error fetching page:", error);
            } finally {
                setLoading(false);
            }
        };

        fetchData();
    }, [params.slug]);

    return (
        <div>
            {loading ? (
                <p>Loading...</p>
            ) : (
                <>
                    <h1>{post.title}</h1>
                    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.content }} />
                </>
            )}
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Add Navigation

While not strictly Directus-related, there are now several pages that aren't linked to each other. In index.jsx, above the <main /> component, add a navigation `<Header/>`. Don't forget to use your specific page slugs.

```js
import { useLocation } from "preact-iso";

export function Header() {
    const { url } = useLocation();

    return (
        <header>
            <nav>
                <a href="/" class={url == "/" && "active"}>
                    Home
                </a>
                <a href="/about" class={url == "/about" && "active"}>
                    About
                </a>
                <a href="/blog" class={url == "/blog" && "active"}>
                    Blogs
                </a>
            </nav>
        </header>
    );
}
```

Next Steps
Through this guide, you have set up an Preact project, created a Directus instance, and used it to query data. You have used a singleton collection for global metadata, dynamically created pages, as well as blog listing and post pages.
